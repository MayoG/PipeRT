Real-time pipeline for video analytics.

Structure
=========
- **pipert**: The library, which contains:
    - **core**: The core parts of the library, the pipeline base 'component' and component's base 'routine'.
    - **utils**: general purpose functions for monitoring, controlling, and massage passing between components and routines.

- **pipert.contrib**: The Contrib directory contains implemented components and routines for various projects.  

The code in **pipert.contrib** is not as fully maintained as the core part of the library. It may change or be removed at any time without notice.

Documentation
=============
API documentation and an overview of the library can be found [here](https://pipert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Installation
